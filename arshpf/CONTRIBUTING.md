## Making Changes

1. Create a new branch from `main`:

   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

2. Make your changes, following the code style guidelines below.

3. Commit with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add dark mode toggle animation"

## Code Style

- **TypeScript** for all React/Next.js components
- **TailwindCSS** for styling (avoid inline styles where possible)
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- Keep components in `/components`, pages in `/app`
- No `any` TypeScript types unless absolutely necessary
- Run `npm run lint` before submitting a PR

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Include a clear description of **what** changed and **why**
- If fixing a bug, reference the issue number: `Fixes #123`
- Screenshots or screen recordings are appreciated for UI changes
- Ensure `npm run build` passes without errors
